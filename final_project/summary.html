        Topic:
    </p>

    <p>
        The topic of my website is a Beijing traveling guide. It has four pages in total, a
        home page containing a summary of Beijing, a places page displaying the most famous places in Beijing to visit, 
        a food page introducing the best restaurants in Beijing, 
        and a resources page for people to use when traveling to Beijing. It serves a detailed travel guide for anyone who is interested in 
        visiting Beijing
    </p>

    <p>
        Purpose: 
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of my website is to introduce people to my hometown and my favorite city, Beijing. 
        I want people to have a guide when they visit Beijing. I have been taking friends to travel in Beijing several times, and I want to make a personal guide with my favorite places, 
        foods, and resources. I hope my website can help people to better enjoy their time in Beijing.

        Extra:
    </p>

    <p>
        The first extra I used is iframe. I put an iframe on every resource I listed on the website so people can directly interact with the website. The second extra I used is form. 
        Many people may have questions about certain places or travel plans after visiting the website. 
        I want to answer those questions to better assist them through the form.
