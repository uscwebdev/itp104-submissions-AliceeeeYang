                     Siji Minfu Restaurant: the award-winning Chinese restaurant which probably comes in between.
                     Siji Minfu’s local specialties further set this restaurant as a sought-after culinary destination. Compared to most other Peking Duck restaurants, it has a slightly better price point.
                     It offers a rare combination of curated menu items, including delicacies from China and other parts of Asia.
                     Each dish is prepared with an assortment of spices to retain its authenticity. It is anchored on ingredient seasonality and says no to MSG. WOW for a Chinese restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The décor at this restaurant is very authentic and follows a very Chinese-like architecture, complete with lanterns and traditional wood carvings.
                    Compared to the ultra-modern atmosphere of Da Dong, Siji Minfu is more classic, with a vibe that is satisfyingly local.
                    This chain is popular for its authentic Peking duck, carved tableside. Locals and tourists alike line up out the door for the famed duck, 
                    expertly roasted so that the skin shatters while the flesh remains tender.
                    Once the duck is ready, it is wheeled out into the dining room on a large platter by a knife-wielding chef.
                    Within seconds, the skin is removed from the breast of the duck in 3 wide strips. The meat underneath is completely undisturbed.

                    Dadong: Selling itself on the claim that its birds (RMB 198 per whole duck) are leaner than those of other roast duck joints, 
                    Da Dong’s two classy branches more or less bookend the 2km strip between Changhong Qiao and Dongsishitiao. 
                    Arguments will never cease as to which kitchen produces Beijing’s best roast ducks, but Da Dong’s ability to transcend the duck genre is marked by its repeated wins 
                    as "Best Chinese Restaurant of the Year" in the Beijinger’s annual Reader Restaurant Awards. 
                    Try dipping a slice of duck in the sugar provided alongside other condiments – somehow, 
                    it works beautifully. 
                    
                <p>
                    The 160-page menu is a work of art in itself, with a plethora of duck dishes backed up by vegetable dishes, soups and more. If you’re only going to eat duck once in Beijing, 
                    book a table – or else be prepared to wait for one – at Da Dong. Voted best "Chinese Restaurant of the Year," "Beijing Duck" and "Best for Impressing Visitors" in the 2011 
                    Reader Restaurant Awards. The signature roast duck only uses 22-day-old birds, and is served with condiments like pancake, cucumber, scallion, minced garlic and bean sauce. 
                    Braised sea cucumber is a sensational tour de force – spiny sea cucumber from Kanto, Japan is prepared tableside à la minute. 
                    Seasonal seafood and mushroom dishes are also the highlights.

                GongYan: Waiters wearing Hanfu walked through the clouds and mist, serving exquisitely plated dishes to the diners. 
                Accompanied by ritual music and dance, a palace night banquet called "Xu Jin Huan" was staged gorgeously.
                 On the stage, the curtain slowly lowered, showing the light and shadow of the bamboo forest. 
                 Li Bai and a young man who traveled back to the Tang Dynasty from modern times met in the depths of the bamboo forest.
